# sheet-to-bot

This project allows anyone who wants to build a useful and flexible bot to telegram simply and easily,

This code is actively used now by two useful bots used by several hundred users. While the bot operators do not have to mess with code and programming at all, their technical background can be very low ðŸ˜Š

The code uses some important principles of object-oriented programming to allow the code to be open to change easily

Feel free to be impressed and use these two bots:
- [The bot of the Student Association of the Lev Academic Center](t.me/aguda_bot)
- [The bot of the high school yeshiva near the Lev Institute](t.me/InfoYatmalBot)

You can use this code by these steps:
1. Create a [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) file that will contain the contents of the buttons in this column format:
   - Button name
   - button type (from the list: text, file, or button)
   - the command that will contain this command as the menu (can be left blank so that this command will not be in the menu)
   - place in row
   - place in column
2. Deploy this project in pythonanywhere or heroku or every host for python webhook
